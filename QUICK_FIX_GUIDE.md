# üö® QUICK FIX: PDF Delivery Issue

## üîç **Root Cause Identified**

Your payment was successful, but the PDF is not being sent because:

1. ‚ùå **Missing Environment Variables**: Your server doesn't have the required credentials
2. ‚ùå **Webhook Delivery Failing**: Stripe can't reach your webhook endpoint properly
3. ‚ùå **Email Service Not Configured**: No Zoho email credentials to send PDFs

## üõ†Ô∏è **IMMEDIATE FIX STEPS**

### Step 1: Create Environment File

Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory with this content:

```env
# REQUIRED: Email Configuration (Zoho)
ZMAIL_USER=contact@corcodusa.ro
ZMAIL_PASS=your_zoho_app_password_here

# REQUIRED: Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret

# Server Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=10000
```

### Step 2: Get Zoho App Password

1. Go to https://mail.zoho.com
2. Login with your corcodusa.ro account
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Mail Accounts** ‚Üí **Security**
4. Click **Generate App Password**
5. Name it "CorcoDu»ôa App"
6. Copy the generated password
7. Replace `your_zoho_app_password_here` in the `.env` file

### Step 3: Get Your Stripe Keys

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_live_`)
3. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_live_`)
4. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
5. Find your webhook endpoint and copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 4: Test the Configuration

After updating the `.env` file, run:

```bash
node test-email-flow.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ ZMAIL_USER: Configured
‚úÖ ZMAIL_PASS: Configured
‚úÖ All email tests completed successfully!
```

### Step 5: Restart Your Server

1. Stop your current server
2. Start it again: `cd backend && npm start`
3. The server will now have the required environment variables

## üîß **Alternative: Manual PDF Delivery**

If you can't set up the email immediately, you can manually send the PDF:

1. **Identify the product**: Based on the payment amount (RON 39.00), this was likely the "Pachet Complet"
2. **Find the PDF**: `backend/public/pdfs/BonusCertificateDeAbsovire.pdf`
3. **Send manually**: Email the PDF to `cris7i_laurentiu@yahoo.com`

## üìã **What Happens After Fix**

Once you set up the environment variables:

1. ‚úÖ **Webhook will be received** by your server
2. ‚úÖ **PDF will be sent automatically** to the customer
3. ‚úÖ **Order notification** will be sent to contact@corcodusa.ro
4. ‚úÖ **Future payments** will work automatically

## üö® **URGENT: Current Customer**

For the current customer (`cris7i_laurentiu@yahoo.com`):

1. **Manual delivery**: Send `BonusCertificateDeAbsovire.pdf` manually
2. **Fix the system**: Set up the environment variables
3. **Test**: Make a test payment to verify everything works

## üìû **Need Help?**

If you need assistance:
1. Check the `ZOHO_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed Zoho setup
2. Verify your Stripe webhook endpoint is correct
3. Test with a small payment first

The key issue is the missing environment variables - once those are set, everything will work automatically!
