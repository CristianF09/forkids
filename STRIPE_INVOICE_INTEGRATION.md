# 🧾 Stripe Invoice Integration Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

This guide shows how to integrate Stripe's automated invoice system with your PDF delivery workflow.

## 📋 **What We've Implemented**

### **1. Dual Webhook Handling**
- ✅ `checkout.session.completed` - Your existing logic
- ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded` - New Stripe invoice handling

### **2. Benefits of Using Stripe Invoices**
- 🧾 **Professional invoices** automatically generated by Stripe
- 📧 **Automatic email delivery** by Stripe
- 🏢 **Tax compliance** and proper documentation
- 🔄 **Automatic retry** for failed payments
- 📊 **Better reporting** in Stripe dashboard

## ⚙️ **Stripe Dashboard Setup**

### **Step 1: Enable Invoices**
1. Go to **Stripe Dashboard** → **Settings** → **Billing**
2. Enable **"Automatically send invoices"**
3. Configure your business information:
   - Company name: `CorcoDușa`
   - Address: Your business address
   - Tax ID: Your tax information

### **Step 2: Configure Invoice Settings**
1. **Invoice Template**: Customize with your branding
2. **Email Settings**: Use your business email
3. **Tax Settings**: Configure for Romanian tax requirements
4. **Payment Terms**: Set to "Due on receipt"

### **Step 3: Webhook Configuration**
1. Go to **Stripe Dashboard** → **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhook`
3. Select these events:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_failed`
   - ✅ `payment_intent.succeeded`

## 🔄 **How It Works**

### **Option 1: Checkout Session (Current)**
```
Customer Payment → checkout.session.completed → PDF Delivery
```

### **Option 2: Stripe Invoice (New)**
```
Customer Payment → Stripe Invoice → invoice.payment_succeeded → PDF Delivery
```

## 📧 **Customer Experience**

### **With Stripe Invoices:**
1. **Customer makes payment**
2. **Stripe automatically sends professional invoice**
3. **Your webhook sends PDF immediately after**
4. **Customer receives both invoice and PDF**

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Professional invoice** from Stripe
- ✅ **Immediate PDF delivery** from your system
- ✅ **Better customer experience**
- ✅ **Compliance with tax requirements**

## 🛠️ **Code Implementation**

### **Webhook Handler**
```javascript
// Handle Stripe's automated invoice events
if (event.type === 'invoice.payment_succeeded') {
  const invoice = event.data.object;
  const customerEmail = invoice.customer_email;
  
  // Extract product info from invoice
  const priceId = invoice.lines.data[0].price.id;
  const product = products[priceId];
  
  // Send PDF to customer
  await sendEmailWithAttachment(customerEmail, product.filePath);
}
```

## 📊 **Monitoring**
