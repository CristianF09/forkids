## 🛠️ **Solutions**

### **🔧 Solution 1: Check Zoho App Password**
The most common cause of "535 Authentication Failed" is using the wrong password type.

**Steps to fix:**
1. **Log into your Zoho account** at https://mail.zoho.eu
2. **Go to Settings** → **Mail Accounts** → **Security**
3. **Generate an App Password** (not your regular password)
4. **Use the App Password** in your environment variables

**How to set App Password:**
```bash
# In your .env file, make sure you're using the App Password:
ZMAIL_USER=contact@corcodusa.ro
ZMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here  # Not your regular password!
```

### **🔧 Solution 2: Check Zoho SMTP Settings**
Make sure SMTP is enabled in your Zoho account.

**Steps:**
1. **Log into Zoho Mail**
2. **Go to Settings** → **Mail Accounts**
3. **Enable SMTP** if it's not already enabled
4. **Check if there are any IP restrictions**

### **🔧 Solution 3: Test with Different Credentials**
If you have multiple Zoho accounts, try testing with a different one.

## 📊 **Current Status**

### **✅ Code Status:**
- ✅ Contact form logic is correct
- ✅ Error handling is working
- ✅ Fallback to development mode is working
- ✅ No 500 errors anymore

### **❌ Email Status:**

## 🎯 **Immediate Actions**

### **1. Check Your Zoho Credentials:**
```bash
# Verify these in your .env file:
ZMAIL_USER=contact@corcodusa.ro
ZMAIL_PASS=your_app_password_here  # Make sure this is an App Password
```

### **2. Generate New App Password:**
1. Go to Zoho Mail settings
2. Generate a new App Password
3. Update your .env file
4. Test again

### **3. Alternative: Use Different Email Service**
If Zoho continues to have issues, consider:
- Gmail SMTP
- SendGrid
- Mailgun

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix Zoho credentials** (most likely solution)
2. **Test email sending** after fixing credentials
3. **Deploy to production** once email works
4. **Monitor email delivery** in production

## 📝 **Testing After Fix**

Once you fix the credentials, test with:
```bash
# Test contact form
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@example.com","message":"Test message"}'
```

**Expected result:** Email should be received at contact@corcodusa.ro
